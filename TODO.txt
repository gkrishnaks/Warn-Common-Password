1) Benchmark against Trie.js - Done - initial trie setup takes some seconds - indexof or includes seems better..

2) Use a compression algorithm to compress data.min.js and decompress in code to reduce addon size and increase word list size
(currently its 0.5 Million, maybe we can increase that limit once we compress)

3) Add a popup which provides setting switch - to limit the Search within top 300000 common passwords only - as it will help older devices or low-end android devices running Firefox.
